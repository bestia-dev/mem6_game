      <h2 class="green">Instructions </h2>
      <h4>This multi-player game is prepared for android smartphones with
        chrome browser and
        internet connection. All players must be around
        the same table. It is best played with 4 players or more.
      </h4>
      <h4>The first player opens the link</h4>
      <h2 class="blue">bestia.dev/mem6</h2>
      <h4>
        On the start page writes his nickname. Clicks `Start group`.
        On the next page is a qr code.
        Other players scan this qr code. It will open the browser
        on the game's webpage. Write your nicknames.
        Put all phones down on the table near each other.
        All smartphones combined will be used as a single game board.
        The first player then chooses the type of game and clicks</h4>
      <h3 class="green">Start "unForGet"</h3>
      <h4>
        On the screen under the card grid are information who plays and
        who waits. Each player flips over two cards
        with two clicks. These cards can be on any smartphone. The cards are
        accompanied by sounds and text on the screen.</h4>
      <h3 class="red">Put your volume up!</h3>
      <h4>
        If the cards match, they are left
        face up permanently and the player receives a point and </h4>
      <h2 class="green">MUST DRINK !</h2>
      <h4>
        The player then clicks on the green page to let the next player play.
        If the cards don't match, they will be later flipped back face down.
        Every player opens only two cards (to make the game faster). It doesn't
        matter if he got a point or not.
        Then it is always the next player's turn to
        click and flip over two cards. <br />
        And so the next and the next and the next...<br />
        The game is over when all the cards are permanently face up.
        <br />Good luck !</h4>
      <h1 class="orange">Enjoy drinking</h1>
      <h2 class="green">and the good company!</h2>
